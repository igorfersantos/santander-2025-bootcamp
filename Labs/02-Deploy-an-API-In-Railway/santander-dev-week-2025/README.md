## Santander API Example

This API is an example of how to develop and publish an API to Railway with Spring Boot with the course videos 
and will serve as a base or starting point to my own API to this challenge

The same original base version of this API is available with improvements and more methods [here](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/santander-dev-week-2023-api)

TODO:

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Refactor with SOLID and Clean Code
- [ ] Improve this API with the enhanced original base version
- [ ] Use this as a base for an API that I would like to build
