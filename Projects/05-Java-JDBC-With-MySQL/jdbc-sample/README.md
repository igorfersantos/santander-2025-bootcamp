# JDBC Sample

This project follows [DIO's JDBC Sample project](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/jdbc-sample)
barebone structure to study Java's JDBC connection with a MySQL Database in mind.

I also took the opportunity to practice and make a few modifications considering 
everything I studied or remembered so far from DIO's Java courses, my previous 
experiences with Java and books.

Future experiments or improvements to do with this project:
- Try Liquibase instead of Flyway
- Make an API out of it
